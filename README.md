# django-react-graphql-starter

A starter kit for Django and React, connected by GraphQL

## Why it matters

Django is a great tool for rapid backend development.  

React is a great tool for rapid frontend development.

This starter brings these two great tools together!

Django has excellent GraphQL support via the [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/) library. With a great deal of ease and very little code you can create your database 
models and expose them to your UI with GraphQL. On the UI side, GraphQL queries and mutations are connected 
to your React components via the wonderful [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

This starter kit also includes an authentication demo using JSON Web Tokens.

## Requirements

* Python
* Node.js
* Yarn (optional)

## Install / Run

### Backend

Edit myapp/settings.py if you want to setup a database connection other than the default sqlite.

```bash
cd be
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser
./manage.py runserver 9090

```

### Frontend

```bash
cd ui
yarn install

```

After install, go to http://localhost:3000 and try logging in with the user you created.


Have fun!
